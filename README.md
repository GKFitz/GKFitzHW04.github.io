Gillian's Coding Quiz


This is a beginners timed, coding quiz. 
It features a dynamically updating HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. I have tried to make it as straightforward, responsive and user friendly as possible for a user to take the coding quiz, receive their score, record and save their score in localStorage. The user then has the option to view their scores and other past players scores to track progress (or gain bragging rights), at which poin they can leave the lis or delete it altogether.
