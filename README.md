This is a beginner's timed, coding quiz. 
It features a dynamically updating HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. I have tried to make this application as straightforward, responsive and user friendly as possible for a user to test their basic coding developer knowledge. After completing the quiz the user receives their score, which can they then enter their initials to save their score to localStorage. The user has 2 minutes to answer all 5 questions, but for every wrong answer, 20 seconds and 20 points is subtracted from their time and score. If the user runs out of time, the quiz will end and they will be prompted  to try again from the beginning. If the user finishes his or her quiz within the 2 minutes they will be prompted to enter their initials which will save their scores and will be redirected to the view scores list. They ahve the option to compile results from multiple games to compare their results, or to clear the score list completely.
