Gillian's Coding Quiz


This is a beginners timed, coding quiz. 
It features a dynamically updating HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript. I have tried to make it as straightforward, responsive and user friendly as possible for a user to take the coding quiz, receive their score, record and save their score in localStorage. The user has 2 minutes to answer all 5 questions, but for every wrong answer, 20 seconds and 20 points is subtracted from the users time and score. If the user runs out of time, they are given the option to try again. If the user finishes the quiz they have the option to view their scores and enter their initials to save those score in the score list everytime they play. They also have the option to clear the score list.
